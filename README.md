# CIS Dance Dance Revolution

![Cover Image](ddrcover.png)

A Dance Dance Revolution-inspired game including some of the CIS professors. Created for CIS 1200.

This game was inspired by the [Chainsaw Dance](https://benedique.itch.io/chainsaw-dance) game. Go check that out too!

Unfortunately, due to anti-cheating policies I'm unable to release the source code for this game. For anyone that wants to know how I made it, please feel free to reach out to me instead!

## Running the game

To run the game, you need Java JRE 17 or later installed on your machine. If you took CIS 1200, you probably already have it installed. Then you should be able to download this folder and run `java -jar ddr.jar`.

Feel free to post your high scores in the discussions here and enjoy!
